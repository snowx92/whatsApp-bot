Project Name: WhatsApp Bulk Messaging Bot

Project Overview:
The WhatsApp Bulk Messaging Bot is a powerful automation tool built using Python and the PyWhatKit library. It simplifies the process of sending messages to multiple contacts on WhatsApp. Users can upload a CSV file containing 10-digit Egyptian phone numbers, and the script automatically adds the +20 Egypt country code before sending messages. The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Tkinter for user-friendly interaction.

Technologies Used:

Python: The primary programming language used for scripting.
PyWhatKit Library: Provides the core functionality for sending WhatsApp messages.
Tkinter: Creating a user-friendly GUI for easy input and interaction.
CSV File Handling: Reading and processing CSV files containing phone numbers.
Key Features:

CSV File Upload: Users can upload a CSV file containing 10-digit Egyptian phone numbers.
Automatic Country Code Addition: The script automatically adds the +20 Egypt country code to the provided phone numbers.
WhatsApp Messaging: Utilizing PyWhatKit, the bot sends messages to the specified contacts efficiently.
Tkinter GUI: A user-friendly graphical interface for input and control.
Your Role:
As the developer of the WhatsApp Bulk Messaging Bot, you played a crucial role in creating the entire system. You developed the Python script using PyWhatKit for WhatsApp messaging and integrated Tkinter to design the user interface. Your script efficiently processes CSV files, adds the country code, and sends messages to the provided phone numbers, simplifying bulk messaging tasks.

Challenges Faced:
One of the primary challenges was integrating PyWhatKit for WhatsApp messaging while ensuring proper authentication and message delivery. Designing an intuitive and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter required careful planning and execution. However, by leveraging Python, PyWhatKit, Tkinter, and your development skills, you successfully overcame these challenges to create an efficient and user-friendly WhatsApp bot for bulk messaging.
